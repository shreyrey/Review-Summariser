📝 Text Summarization Using a Sequence-to-Sequence Model with Attention
🚀 Introduction

Text summarization is a vital Natural Language Processing (NLP) task aimed at extracting the most important information from large volumes of text while preserving context and meaning. As digital content grows exponentially—ranging from product reviews to news articles—manual summarization becomes impractical. Automated summarization offers a scalable solution to improve efficiency in information consumption and decision-making.

This project, "Text Summarization Using a Sequence-to-Sequence Model with Attention," leverages deep learning to perform abstractive summarization on user-generated content. By training on a dataset of Amazon product reviews and their human-written summaries, the model learns to produce concise, coherent, and humanlike summaries.
🎯 Objective

The primary goal is to develop a deep learning-based summarization system that can:

    ✂️ Condense lengthy reviews while preserving key information.

    🗣️ Paraphrase content using natural language.

    🤖 Understand complex language structures.

    🔁 Eliminate redundancy in summaries.

    ⚙️ Scale to handle real-world volumes of text.

Why Seq2Seq with Attention?

    📐 Seq2Seq: Ideal for mapping variable-length input to variable-length output.

    🎯 Attention: Focuses on relevant parts of the input during summary generation.

    🔄 Adaptable: Transferable across domains with fine-tuning.
